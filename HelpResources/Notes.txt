todo (harder):






 - encapsulation - make methods and variables private as needed and use getters and setters to access things
 - error handling for all classes and methods
 - handle wrong unit errors
 - connect to a database
 - incorporate date into savings account, investment account, and user for when they created or deleted an account
 - add a foreign currency exchange based on an api
 - add interest to the savings accounts by using date (see if you can get an api for the fed's rate to pass to users
   but research if banks add a few more points to it)
 - create a front end??


todo (easier):
 - test new methods in compliance manager
 - hava a loop for check balances by using time (checks every 30 minutes)
